    "Adding a constant term to the predictor in a regression model is important for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Intercept Estimation: The constant term (intercept) allows the model to estimate the baseline value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. Without it, the model is forced to pass through the origin (0,0), which may not be appropriate for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Flexibility: Including a constant term increases the flexibility of the model, allowing it to fit the data better by adjusting the baseline level.\n",

    "3. Bias Reduction: It helps in reducing bias in the estimation of the coefficients of the independent variables.\n",
